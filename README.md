## Program 1 <br/>
This Program is used to Find the Maximum and Minnimum Element From an Array.<br />
## Program 2 <br/>
This Program is used to find the length of Longest Arithmetic SubArray <br /> 
##### Note<br/>
1. In an array of size n, For Every i from 0 to n-1 max till i is an increasing function i.e its Value Increases or Remains Constant.
2. Number of Subarrays of an array with n elements = nC2 + n = n(n+1)/2.
3. Number of Subsequences of an array with elements = 2^n.
4. Every Subarray is a Subsequence but every Subsequence is not a SubArray.
